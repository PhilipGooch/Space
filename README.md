The aim of this game is to float around in space blowing up meteors. When you hit one, it will break in to four smaller 
meteors. Whenever a meteor floats out of sight the meteor will de-spawn and a new meteor will spawn in its place. If the
small meteors float out of sight they will spawn new big ones so it is worth picking them off! It can become over crowded
quickly if you dont.
